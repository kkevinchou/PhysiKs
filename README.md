# PhysiKs! - A 2D rigid body physics engine

## Completed
* Definition of arbitrary bodies through point locations
* Linear collision detection and resolution
* Spatial partitioning to speed up broad-phase collision detection

## Goals
* Rotational collision resolution
* Verification of rigid bodies by rejecting non-convex definitions
* Resting contacts
* Basic constraints such as springs
